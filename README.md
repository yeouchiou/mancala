# Mancala

Game to play Mancala. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala. Adapted from a cs32 project.

Players take turns to picking up stones on a Mancala grid and distributing them one by one in a counter clockwise fashion. If the final stone lands in a player's pot, they may take another turn. If they land in an empty hole on their side, they may capture the stones of the corresponding hole on the opponent's side. Game ends when there are no stones on all holes on one player's side. The rest of the stones on the other side are given to that pot. The player with the most stones in the pot wins.
